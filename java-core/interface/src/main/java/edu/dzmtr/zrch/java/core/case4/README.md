### Functional interface and inheritance
Create you own functional interface that extends non-functional interface with two abstract methods inside

### Explanation
> Functional interface also can contain abstract versions of methods that have implementation in Object class: toString(), equals(Object obj) and hashCode(). Since these methods will get default implementation from the Object class, they donâ€™t violate single function contract. The same if they are inherited from the super-interface.
